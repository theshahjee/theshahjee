# Abdullah Mughees - AI & ML Developer

## About Me

I'm Abdullah Mughees — a Python & AI Developer, Full Stack Engineer, and AI Solutions Architect with a strong foundation in Computer Science from FAST NUCES. I specialize in building intelligent, scalable, and real-time systems driven by machine learning and automation.

With a proven track record across industries, I’ve led AI and backend development at SONORIA and VERTICALSOLS, co-founded PsuedoBytes, and contributed as a full stack engineer at IndustryRockstarsAI. My technical stack spans across Generative AI (LLMs, GPT, LangChain), real-time data pipelines, and predictive analytics — blending automation with business value.

As a Full Stack Developer, I’ve architected and deployed numerous end-to-end solutions using modern web frameworks (React, Next.js, Node.js) and cloud platforms (Firebase, Supabase, Render, Vercel). My passion lies in solving real-world problems through AI, clean code, and resilient architecture.

Whether it's automating complex workflows, designing NLP pipelines, or optimizing data flows — I bring a practical, results-driven mindset to every project.
